# McDonald-s-Menu-SQL-Data-Analysis

Introduction

THE SQL DATA ANALYSIS PROJECT AIMS TO EXPLORE AND GAIN INSIGHTS FROM A COMPREHENSIVE DATASET CONTAINING MAJOR mCdONALDS MENU ITEMS ALONG WITH THEIR MENU CATEGORIES AND NUTRITIVE FACTS.

THIS PROJECT WILL PROVIDE  VALUABLE INSIGHTS INTO MCDONALDS MENU COMPOSITION AND NUTRITIONAL ASPECTS, ENABLING BETTER UNDERSTANDING AND DECISION-MAKING REGARDING THE MENU OFFERINGS.

Dataset Description

The Dataset used for this project consists of a collection of McDonald's items. Each item is associated with its menu category such as breakfast, burgers, salads, desserts, chicken, etc, and includes nutritional facts like calories, fat, carbohydrates, and protein content.

Project Goals

>  Exploratory Analysis
>  Menu Item Analysis
>  Category Analysis
>  Nutritional Analysis
>  Conclusion & Reporting

Exploratory Analysis

Perform an exploratory analysis of the dataset to gain a comprehensive understanding of its structure, data types, and completeness. Identify any data quality issues, missing values, or inconsistencies that need to be addressed before proceeding with the analysis.


Menu Item Analysis

Analyze the nutritional values of menu items using SQL queries and calculations. Calculate key statistics, such as average, maximum, and minimum values for calories, fat, carbohydrates, and protein. Identify the most and least calorific items on the menu and explore the distribution of nutritional values across the dataset.


Category Analysis

Investigate the composition of menu categories using SQL queries and aggregations. Count the number of items in each category with the highest and lowest number of items, and compare the nutritional values across different categories. Generate insights into the distribution and diversity of menu items within each category.


Nutritional Analysis

Dive deeper into the nutritional aspects of menu items using SQL queries and calculations. calculate average values for calories, fat, carbohydrates, and protein across the entire menu. Identify the items with the highest and lowest nutritional content. Analyze the relationship between different nutritional variables, such as the correlation between calories and fat.


Conclusion & Reporting

Summarize the findings and insights derived from the SQL data analysis. Present the result through a final report or presentation, including visualization, tables, and key observation. conclude the project by highlighting the key takeaways and implications for McDonald's menu composition and nutritional considerations.
